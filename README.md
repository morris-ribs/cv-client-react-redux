# cv-client-react-redux

A CV page, full responsive, that retrieves the candidate's data from a dummy server and displays it.

It uses **React (Redux/Thunk)** and **SASS** 

# To run it (without Docker)

## Clone the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/morris-ribs/cv-client-react-redux.git
```

## Run it

```bash
$ npm start
```

It is going to start the server on port **4000**, and the client on port **8800**

## Open it on the browser

Open http://localhost:8080/ on your beloved web browser.

# Next Steps

For next phase, I am going to dockerize the solution, so that you can run it inside a container.
